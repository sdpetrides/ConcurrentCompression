A multithreaded and a multiprocessed multipart compression program.

DESIGN

Take an uncompressed txt file (bigfile.txt) as input and output multiple compressed files (bigfile_txt_RLE, bigfile_txt_LOLS, bigfile_txt_LOLS0, bigfile_txt_LOLS1).

The multitreaded program will spawn threads for each part (compressT_LOLS).
The multiprocessed program will spawn children for each part (compressR_LOLS).

Special Case Handling

If there not an even split of the characters to parts, we put the entire remainder into the first file.
