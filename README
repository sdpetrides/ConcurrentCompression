A multithreaded and a multiprocessed multipart compression program.

DESIGN

Take an uncompressed txt file (bigfile.txt) as input and output multiple compressed files (bigfile_txt_RLE, bigfile_txt_LOLS, bigfile_txt_LOLS0, bigfile_txt_LOLS1).

The multitreaded program will spawn threads for each part (compressT_LOLS).
The multiprocessed program will spawn children for each part (compressR_LOLS).

SPECIAL CASE HANDLING

If there not an even split of the characters to parts, we put the entire remainder into the first file.
Non-alphabetical characters are skipped and not considered in the compressed string.
Our first output file is named with a filename_txt_LOLS0.txt.
Our maximum string size is 1000 characters. After this mark the program will exit and report the maximum character limit has been reached.
An error is reported and the program exits if the number of parts is less than one.
